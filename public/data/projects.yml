      A self-service platform for creating and lifecycling GCP landing zones. In my role
      I put together an initial design and proposal for a platform that helps teams to
      easily provision a GCP environment so that they can focus on delivering value to
      the organisation. I also led the development of the platform, which was built using
      a combination of cloud-native technologies delivered by GCP, Github Actions and
      Terraform.
    shortDesc: |-
      Led the design and development of a self-service platform for creating and managing GCP landing zones. Implemented cloud-native technologies using GCP, GitHub Actions, and Terraform to streamline environment provisioning. The platform significantly reduced provisioning time and enhanced developer productivity, leading to its adoption across multiple departments.

      A well architected pattern for deploying and managing AKS clusters using GitOps. In
      my role I was responsible for the initial technical pre-sales and discovery which
      led to the design and implementation of a Kubernetes platform on Azure with a view
      to shifting the organisation to a GitOps model. Additional features included canary
      deployments, automated testing and ephemeral environments to support UAT and QA.

      A Kubernetes platform for shared services and applications. In my role I was
      responsible for planning and implementing a Kubernetes platform on Azure to host
      shared services and required to support a new SaaS product from the development
      team. These features included Vault, Consul, Keycloak, Jenkins and Artifactory. A
      large degree of focus was placed on standardisation and automation to ensure the
      platform was easy to operate and maintain. To achieve this I designed a number of
      deployment patterns to facilitate workload identity, automated DNS and global load
      balancing.

      A proof of concept for a service mesh on Kubernetes. In my role I played a
      supporting role during the technical pre-sales and discovery phase to produce
      supporting documentation and a high-level design for a highly technical client.
      After the completion of the discovery phase I was responsible for the delivery of
      the chosen service mesh, Istio, and the development of a deployment pattern that
      could be used to evaluate the viability of Istio as a global load balancing
      solution.
