  #     A well architected pattern for deploying and managing AKS clusters using GitOps. In
  #     my role I was responsible for the initial technical pre-sales and discovery which
  #     led to the design and implementation of a Kubernetes platform on Azure with a view
  #     to shifting the organisation to a GitOps model. Additional features included canary
  #     deployments, automated testing and ephemeral environments to support UAT and QA.

  #     A Kubernetes platform for shared services and applications. In my role I was
  #     responsible for planning and implementing a Kubernetes platform on Azure to host
  #     shared services and required to support a new SaaS product from the development
  #     team. These features included Vault, Consul, Keycloak, Jenkins and Artifactory. A
  #     large degree of focus was placed on standardisation and automation to ensure the
  #     platform was easy to operate and maintain. To achieve this I designed a number of
  #     deployment patterns to facilitate workload identity, automated DNS and global load
  #     balancing.

  #     A proof of concept for a service mesh on Kubernetes. In my role I played a
  #     supporting role during the technical pre-sales and discovery phase to produce
  #     supporting documentation and a high-level design for a highly technical client.
  #     After the completion of the discovery phase I was responsible for the delivery of
  #     the chosen service mesh, Istio, and the development of a deployment pattern that
  #     could be used to evaluate the viability of Istio as a global load balancing
  #     solution.
